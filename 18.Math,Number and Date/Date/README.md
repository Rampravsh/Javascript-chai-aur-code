# JavaScript Date Object Exploration

This project is part of the "Chai aur Code" JavaScript series, focusing on understanding and using the `Date` object in JavaScript.

## About

The `index.js` file contains various examples and experiments with the JavaScript `Date` object. This includes:

- **Creating `Date` Objects**: Demonstrates various ways to instantiate a `Date`.
- **Static Methods**: Shows usage of `Date.now()` and `Date.parse()`.
- **Getter Methods**: Examples of `getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()`, `getHours()`, etc.
- **Setter Methods**: Examples of `setFullYear()`, `setMonth()`, `setDate()`, etc.
- **Formatting Methods**: Covers `toString()`, `toDateString()`, `toISOString()`, and more.
- **Locale-Specific Formatting**: Explores `toLocaleString()` for customized, human-readable date and time output.
- **Timestamps**: Working with milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing `F12`) to see the output from `index.js`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to instantiate `Date` objects.
- Learn about the various `get`, `set`, and formatting methods.
- Differentiate between local time and UTC methods.
- Customize date and time formatting for locale-specific output using `toLocaleString()` and its options.
