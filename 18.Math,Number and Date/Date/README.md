# JavaScript Date Object Exploration

This project is part of the "Chai aur Code" JavaScript series, focusing on understanding and using the `Date` object in JavaScript.

## About

The `index.js` file contains various examples and experiments with the JavaScript `Date` object. This includes:

- Creating new `Date` objects.
- Getting different parts of a date (year, month, day, etc.).
- Formatting dates into strings.
- Working with timestamps.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing `F12`) to see the output from `index.js`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to instantiate `Date` objects.
- Learn about the various `get` and `set` methods.
- Explore different ways to represent dates and times.
- Customize date and time formatting for locale-specific output using `toLocaleString()`.
