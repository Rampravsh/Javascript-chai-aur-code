// ARRAY IN JAVASCRIPT
//an array is a list that can store multiple values in one place
// Think of it like a row of boxes.where each box can hold one item (like a number word etc )
//You can use it to group similar thing together

//Create array using array Literal method (recommended):
let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
let marks = [23, 84, 34, 56];
let personDetaols = ["riy", 10, "bihar"];

//create array using array constructor:
let arr = new Array("spiderman", "ironman", "thor");
